## User Guide

### 1. Program Introduction

Hello! We are Group 22.
Our program is called "If You Are The One", aimed at helping students find their best fit TA. 
We have 3 functions, all of which would have interaction with users in a web app:

- "Search": In this function, user can search for any TA's information, including the name, pictureï¼Œpronoun, email, quiz section, IPL time, and a personal introduction. This function helps users to be familiar with the basic information of this TA.

- "Blind date": This function would help match the user up with his/her ideal TA. Each TA is represented as a bulb and here users can select their expectations, such as their anticipated section time or teaching styles. After the selection, the TA satisfied most preferred types, or in other words, has the highest scores, is displayed by lighting the related bulb. Note that we only have 8 data used in this function. 

- "View the intended Section": In this funtion, we will present the statistics of users who have already chosen the same TA and the capacity of this section. Given that there are usually limited spots in the registration of a section and each student's registration time is usually different, it's better for a user to know how many other students want this TA too. Thus it would give the user a second chance to think about whether this TA/section is the most suitable.

##### In the three functions above, users can end the program anytime and directly display the results.
