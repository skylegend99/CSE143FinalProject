Program Reflection

1. What did you learn during this project?

In this project, we mostly learnt about the mechanism of GUI (stands for Graphical User Interface), 
which enables us to interact with users through graphical icons and present a better visualized results, 
such as reading the pictures of each TA from a file.

Also, in the auto-correct process, we learnt to use Levenshtein distance algorithm for measuring 
the difference and compare the similarity between two strings. The smaller the return results, the 
closer the strings. This improves our search results a lot.

2. What did you enjoy during this project?

Through this project, we did enjoy working toghther as a group. We came up with this idea together, 
and we kept improving it all the time. It was an exciting moment when we figure out how to illlustrate our 
program and make it interesting. And we aredelighted to have a chance to show out gratefulness to our TAs 
throughout this program. There's really a sense of accomplishment when seeing this program is done.

3. What did you find challenging or frustrating during this project?

One challenging part was to learn how to utilize GUI. Since it was a brand new concept to us, we watched youtube 
video tutorials and download some GUI example codes and figured out how to use it. Another challenge is to creat classes
and utilize it in the main client. We saw it done in each of the assessment and it is the first time we are actually 
writing the code to associate classes with classes. 

4. What did you find particularly helpful for your learning during this project?

Communications. We held a group meeting almost 2-3 times a week and we have a group chat.
Thus anytime each of us got stuck or had questions, we could communicate immediately and settle the problems down.
