This function would help match the user up with his/her ideal TA.
Here users can select their expectations, such as their preferred section time,
preferred teaching styles or preferred personalities of this TA.
Note: You could select Null as its feature but make sure you choose enough
features to generate a TA. No bulb light up means no TA found
